# hao-app-ui

Welcome to the hao-app-ui UI  repository! This repository contains the code for a real estate app UI design developed using Flutter.

This UI implementation was inspired by the designs of [Uplabs](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/real-estate-app-ui-ux-design-da941de2-62f1-47f3-92a5-a8646f70d774)

This is just a starter, nothing comprehensive, but it can be ported to any kind of ecommerce app, by just changing the dummy text and images.
